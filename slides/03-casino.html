    <h2>‚ö∞Ô∏è Tomb #1: Casino Fish Tank (2017) üêü</h2>
    <h3>When Your Aquarium Betrays You</h3>
    <div class="code-block">
Attack Vector: Internet-connected aquarium thermometer<br>
Location: Luxury casino lobby<br>
Target: High-roller customer database<br>
Exfiltration: Through the thermostat to cloud storage<br>
<span class="highlight">Detection: Darktrace AI noticed unusual data flow</span>
    </div>
    <h3>How It Happened:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Smart thermostat had vulnerability in firmware</li>
        <li>Device connected to main casino network (no segmentation)</li>
        <li>Attackers exploited IoT device as entry point</li>
        <li>Accessed database and exfiltrated via same device</li>
        <li>Data sent "up to the cloud" through thermostat's connection</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="warning"><strong>Lesson:</strong> Even a $50 fish tank thermometer can compromise a multi-million dollar casino. IoT devices expand your attack surface exponentially.</p>
